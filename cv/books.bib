  abstract={What challenges arise when deploying a novel technology at increasing scale? This case study details our experience developing and deploying technologies to monitor power outages and voltage fluctuations at high temporal and geographic frequency. After a small initial pilot, our deployment grew over time and eventually exceeded 450 sensors and 3500 mobile app downloads with households and firms across Accra, Ghana. Our first lesson is that ad hoc solutions to deployment challenges may not scale, as larger scales bring unique challenges requiring unique and progressively more complex solutions. Second, challenges that arise with scale span distinct domains -- not only technological but also cultural, organizational, and operational. Finally, we stress the importance of adaptability of operational structure, and of frequently updating operational strategy based on new learnings.},
