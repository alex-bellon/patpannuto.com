## Job Talk

N.b. I didn't post this publicly while I was on the market. Not for any
particular reason, but the talk did slowly refine over the course of the
interview season. I probably stopped making significant changes after
interviewing at CMU, so roughly halfway through.

With some time on both sides of the interviewing process now, I don't think
there is huge benefit to sinking significant time into tailoring to schools,
but it is nice to make some small touches. As some concrete examples of things
I did that went over well:

 - If you're going to talk about what you would like to teach, update the list
   of topics to include course numbers from the school you're at; it takes just
   a few minutes and the people who care about teaching will notice.
 - If there's some _recent_ work related to (but not _too_ related â€“ schools
   generally don't want to hire what they already have, they're looking for
   complimentary skillsets) your proposed work, dropping quick mentions of how
   your proposed work would build on / use / etc others work grabs attention.
   Worth doing if you knew about it before interviewing there, probably not
   worth trying to hunt it down.

This is my talk as I gave it at UCSD:
